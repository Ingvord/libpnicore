Installing pniutils
===================

Requirements to build the library
---------------------------------
Minimum requirements:
C++ Compiler g++ >= 4.1
Boost library > 1.4
SCons build system >= ?

Requirements for test code
cppunit and plplot

The later libraries are only needed if the testing code should be 
compiled. 

The compiler should be provided by your operation system's distribution.
In paritcular for old Linux distributions (like Scientific Linux) the Boost
libraries are too old for a successful build. In this case you have to 
install the Boost libraries manually.
The sources for Boost can be downloaded from www.boost.org. For installation 
follow the Boost documentation.

Simple build and install
------------------------
To build the library on an up-to-date Linux system simply type

> scons library 

this should usually build the library. 
If you have the Boost library on a costum site you can add the path 
to the Boost installation prefix with

> scons BOOSTPREFIX=/opt/boost library

To install the library to /home/eugen/Applications/inst use

> scons PREFIX=/home/eugen/Applications/inst BOOSTPREFIX=/opt/boost install

In order to install to a system wide location root permissions are required 
of coarse. 



Building Debian packages
------------------------

Actually there is rudimentary support for building Debian packages that should work 
for all systems based on Debian GNU/Linux (Ubuntu and others). 
For building the packages simply type 

>dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us

This should be integrated in the build system later to make management of 
library versions easier. 

Building RPM packages
---------------------
