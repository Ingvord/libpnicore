Installing pniutils
===================

Requirements
------------
Minimum requirements:
C++ Compiler g++ >= 4.1
Boost library > 1.4

Requirements for test code
cppunit and plplot

The later libraries are only needed if the testing code should be 
compiled. 

The compiler should be provided by your operation system's distribution.
In paritcular for old Linux distributions (like Scientific Linux) the Boost
libraries are too old for a successfull build. In this case you have to 
install the Boost libraries manually.

Download the source code distribution from the boost website (www.boost.org).
For Linux systems tarballs compressed with bzip2 or gzip are available.



Simple build and install
------------------------
To build the library on an up-to-date Linux system simply type

> scons library 

this should usually build the library. 
If you have the Boost library on a costum site you can add the path 
to the Boost installation prefix with

> scons BOOSTPREFIX=/opt/boost library

To install the library to /home/eugen/Applications/inst use

> scons PREFIX=/home/eugen/Applications/inst BOOSTPREFIX=/opt/boost install

In order to install to a system wide location root permissions are required 
of coarse.
