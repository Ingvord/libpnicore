                                   ==========
                     The foundation of the PNI library stack
                     ---------------------------------------

libpnicore is the foundation of the PNI library stack. It provides data structures
and functions used by all other libraries within the stack. These data
structures include

-> a set of well defined data types along with utilities around them
-> multidimensional arrays
-> facilities to quickly implement command line options and arguments
   for programs
-> type erasures for scalar and array objects
-> a set of exceptions used by all other libraries 

libpnicore supports pkg-config and thus, once installed, can easily be used 

$g++ -oprogram program.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs pnicore)
