%%% introduction to the PNI utilities library

The PNI\footnote{PNI stands for Photon, Neutron, and Ion.} utilities library
(libpniutils) provides, as its name already indicates, a couple of utility 
functions and objects that should make  life easier for developers writting 
software that should run on PNI-facilities.

This users guid is the first document developers should read before starting 
to work with the library.
