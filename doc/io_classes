/*! \defgroup io_classes IO classes
    Classes responsible for reading (and maybe in future writing) data. The 
    aim of these classes is to read data from proprietary image formats used 
    by detector vendors. Actually only TIFF and the CBF dialect from DECTRIS
    are supported.

    The IO classes distinguish between two different kinds of file formats
    - image formats
    - and spreadsheet formats

    In the following subsection these two concepts will be explained in more
    detail.

    \subsection image_formats Image formats

    Image formats usually consists of a binary or ASCII file-wide global header
    followed by one or more images. An individual image by itself can consist of
    a specific header which is written in ASCII or binary followed by the image
    data. It is important to note that image data must not subsequently follow
    the image header but can be stored somewhere in the file. 

    An individual image can consist of several layers (channel) where the data
    of each channel can be represented by a different data type. 
    Class ImageInfo holds the basic information for each individual image in a
    file. This information includes the resolution of the image, the number of
    pixels per channel, and the data-type used for each channel. Every reader
    class must gather this information from the file for each image stored in
    it. 

    \subsection spreadsheet_formats Spreadsheet formats

    This are typically ASCII formats used by a lot of experiment control systems
    (FIO from ONLINE at DESY or SPEC at the ESRF). As the name used for these
    formats suggests data is stored in a spreadsheet like manner. Such files may
    have a global header and store a single (like FIO) or many (like SPEC)
    spreadsheets.
    Each spreadsheet consist again of a header and a couple of columns which
    hold the data. The data of each column is of a particular data-type and can
    be a scalar value or a multidimensional array. 
    The entries from all columns at a particular point in the measurement form a
    record. Reading records is currently not supported.
    Data can be stored in a column wise or record-wise order. In the former case
    record data is stored subsequent in the file while in the latter case the
    data of each column is linear in the file-stream.

    Full support of TIFF files except for bi-color images using a single Bit for
    each pixel.
