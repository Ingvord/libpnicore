Cases for array views
---------------------

Need to simplify the interface for array views. This stuff is far too complex. 

We use here the following terminology

mdarray ............ denotes the basic array template
view ............... view type
value_type ......... the value type of the mdarra
cview .............. constant view type

There are two basic cases:
-> selection by a variadic template where the types are either integers or
   slices
-> a single container which has a value type if either an integer or a slice.

For the variadic template case we have the following situation

value_type mdarray(ITYPES ...indexes) const; where all indexes are integers
cview mdarray(ITYPES ...indexes) const;      if one of the indexes is a slice
value_type &mdarray(ITYPES ...indexes);      where all indexes are integers
view mdarray(ITYPES ...indexes);             if one of the indexes is a slice

For the container case we have 

template<
         template<vtype> class CTYPE<
         typename vtype
        >
value_type
