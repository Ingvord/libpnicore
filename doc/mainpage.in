/*! \defgroup error_classes Exception classes

Libpniutils provides a set of standard exceptions that can be used throughout
your C++ code. All exceptions derive from a base class Exception
which by itself is a child  of std::exception. Each exception has a name,
an issuer and a description which can be evaluated by the instance that
catches the exception. The issuer is the signature of the method or
function that throws the exception.
To simplify the setup of the exception system use the
EXCEPTION_SETUP() macro at the very beginning of a method or function to
initialize some local variables which will be used for exception handling.
In case of an error the macros EXCEPTION_INIT() and EXCEPTION_THROW()
can be used to initialize and throw a particular exception.

To explain this in more detail lets have a look in the following example:
\code
int myfunction(double x,double y){
    EXCEPTION_SETUP("int myfunction(double x,double y)");

    ..... code omitted ....

    if(x<0){
        EXCEPTION_INIT(RangeError,"X must not be smaller than 0!");
        EXCEPTION_THROW();
    }

    ..... code omitted ....

}
\endcode
Right after the definition of the function the macro EXCEPTION_SETUP() is
called where the signature of the function is passed as its only argument.
This signature will be later used as the issuer for all exceptions thrown
within this function.
Later when an error occurs EXCEPTION_INIT() is used to initialize an
exception of a particular type along with a description of the error.
In the example above RangeError exception is thrown.
Finally use EXCEPTION_THROW() to throw the exception.
